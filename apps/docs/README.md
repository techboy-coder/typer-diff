`type-diff` is a library to diff two strings, useful for showing for typing games or for showing differences between two strings. It is a simple library that is easy to use and has no dependencies. It is also very fast and lightweight.

## Demo App

This is a simple Next.js app that uses the `typer-diff` library to show an input field where you can type and see the diff between the original text and the typed text. (Similar to typing games like [monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com/)).
